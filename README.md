This position data of  Staubli TX200 robot can be used for error calibration.
We provide 70 sample points of StaubliTX200 robot, which can be used for the verification of  robot calibration algorithm. 
The remaining 85 sample points will be published online after accepting our paper. 
You can read the following papers to understand the principle and methods of robot calibration. 
Here, x1, y1, z1 are the coordinates of the position of the robotâ€™s end-effector in the base coordinate system, 
x, y, z are the coordinate value measured by the laser tracker, 
q1, q2, q3, q4, q5, q6 are the joint angles of the robot.

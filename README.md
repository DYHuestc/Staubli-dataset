# Staubli dataset
This position data of  Staubli TX200 robot in robotic smoothing system can be used for error calibration.
We provide 70 sample points of StaubliTX200 robot, which can be used for the verification of  smoothing system calibration algorithm. 
The remaining sample points will be published online after accepting our paper. 
You can read the following papers to understand the principle and methods of polishing system calibration. 
Here, x1, y1, z1 are the coordinates of the position of the robot’s end-effector in the base coordinate system, which are shown by the teach pendant.
x, y, z are the coordinate value measured by the laser tracker, 
q1, q2, q3, q4, q5, q6 are the joint angles of the robot，which can be obtained from the teach pendant.
